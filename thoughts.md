- There are only 0b10 kinds of people; those who understand binary and those who donâ€™t.
- There is a dream I'm living.. There is a life I'm dreaming of.
- Keep a green tree in your heart, the bird will come automatically.
- The design is finished not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
